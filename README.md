# P1NG Frontend UI

This is the frontend UI for the [P1NG](https://github.com/drona-gyawali/p1ng) backend, allowing users to test their internet speed.

As of now, there arenâ€™t different servers available in multiple locations for precise test, so results may not be fully accurate.  
This project serves as a functional prototype, providing a clear picture of both the backend and frontend integration.
